# Binda Development Roadmap

## üìã Project Overview

**Binda** is a **SaaS platform** designed for small businesses to stay organized. Multiple businesses can register on the platform, and each business gets their own isolated workspace to manage **customer records, transactions, and simple invoices** ‚Äî all in one place, without the stress of scattered notes, WhatsApp chats, and sales books.

### üè¢ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- **Business Registration**: Each business creates an account and gets their own workspace
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation between different businesses' data
- **User Management**: Each business can have multiple users (owner, employees)
- **Billing & Subscriptions**: SaaS pricing model for business accounts

## üéØ Current Project State

### ‚úÖ **What's Already Built:**
- **Next.js 15 + Supabase Foundation** - Complete authentication system
- **UI Components** - Modern UI with TailwindCSS and Radix UI components  
- **Authentication Flow** - Login, signup, password reset, protected routes
- **Theme Support** - Dark/light mode switching

### üöß **What We Need to Build:**
The project is currently a **Next.js + Supabase starter template** that needs to be transformed into **Binda** - a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for small business management.
